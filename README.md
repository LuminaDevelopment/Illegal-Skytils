    Illegal Skytils
  </h1>
  <br>
  Illegal Skytils is a modified version of the original Skytils which lets (you) see all the<br> skytils visuals through walls giving you an unfair advantage (no one cares).<br>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è This mod is against <Strong>Hypixel Skyblock TOS</Strong> and can get you <Strong>banned</Strong> ‚ö†Ô∏è<br>
  <i>(very unlikely though as it currently is only visuals)</i>

## üí° Usage
**to open the Skytils you can run  the following command: (result will be the same)**
> /ist

> /illegalskytils

**‚ùó/skytils** & **/st** will not work!‚ùó**

if you need to run any other skytils command like _**/stping**_ simply use _**/st**_ and not _**/ist**_




## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Install Forge 1.8.9**
      - i hope you know how to (and im not going to explain it)

2. **Uninstall Old Skytils**
      - head to your mods folder and replace the normal skytils with illegal skytils (see releases)
      > note that Illegal skyblock has all the same features of normal skytils so no need to keep the old skytils



if you'd like you can commit to this project to add other cool things such as macros, esp and more but for now this was just a fun little project that i made to make my life easier ‚ù§Ô∏è
